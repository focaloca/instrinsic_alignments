@article{kilbinger_cosmology_2015,
	Abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter
inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust
cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational
cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

@article{kirk_cross-correlation_2015,
	Abstract = {We measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}). The effects of gravitational lensing on different sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same mass fluctuations. We use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ of the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}) Science Verification data and overlapping {CMB} lensing from the South Pole Telescope ({SPT}) and Planck. The {DES} source galaxies have a median redshift of \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm med\} \{{\textbackslash}sim\} 0.7\$, while the {CMB} lensing kernel is broad and peaks at \$z\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2\$. The resulting cross-correlation is maximally sensitive to mass fluctuations at \$z\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.44\$. Assuming the Planck 2015 best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the {DES}\${\textbackslash}times\${SPT} cross-power is found to be \$A = 0.88 {\textbackslash}pm 0.30\$ and that from {DES}\${\textbackslash}times\$Planck to be \$A = 0.86 {\textbackslash}pm 0.39\$, where \$A=1\$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. These are consistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of \$2.9 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.2 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ respectively. We demonstrate that our results are robust to a number of important systematic effects including the shear measurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and {CMB} lensing systematics. Significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes would increase the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate a value of \$A = 1.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.36\$ for {DES}\${\textbackslash}times\${SPT} when we correct the observations with a simple {IA} model. With three measurements of this cross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliable evidence for any deviation from the expected {LCDM} level of cross-correlation, given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact of systematic errors, particularly {IAs}. We provide forecasts for the expected signal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year {DES} survey and {SPT}-3G.},

@article{kitching_limits_2016,
	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the commonly-used approximations for two-point cosmic shear statistics. We discuss the four most prominent assumptions in this statistic: the flat-sky, tomographic, Limber and configuration-space approximations, that the vast majority of cosmic shear results to date have used simultaneously. Of these approximations we find that the flat-sky approximation suppresses power by {\textgreater}1\% on scales of l{\textless}100 and the standard Limber approximation implementation enhances power by {\textgreater}5\% on scales l{\textless}100; in doing so we find an l-dependent factor that has been neglected in analyses to date. To investigate the impact of these approximations we reanalyse the {CFHTLenS} 2D correlation function results. When using all approximations we reproduce the result that measurements of the matter power spectrum amplitude are in tension with measurements from the {CMB} Planck data: where a conditional value of sigma8=0.789 +/- 0.015 is found from {CFHTLenS} and sigma8=0.830 +/- 0.015 from Planck. When we do not use the Limber and flat-sky approximations we find a conditional value of sigma8=0.801 +/- 0.016 from the {CFHTLenS} data, significantly reducing the tension between Planck {CMB} results and lensing results from {CFHTLenS}. When including the additional effect of expected photometric redshift biases we find sigma8=0.839 +/- 0.017 which is consistent with Planck. We also discuss the impact on {CMB} lensing. For Euclid, {LSST}, and {WFIRST} and any current or future survey none of these approximations should be used.},

@article{koksbang_accurately_2018,
	Abstract = {Weak lensing will play an important role in future cosmological surveys, including e.g. Euclid and the Square Kilometre Array. Sufficiently accurate theoretical predictions are important for correctly interpreting these surveys and hence for extracting correct cosmological parameter estimations. We quantify for the first time in a relativistic setting how many post-Born and lens-lens coupling corrections are required for sub-percent accuracy of the theoretical weak lensing convergence and distance-redshift relation for z{\textless}2 (the primary weak lensing range for Euclid and {SKA}). We do this by randomly ray-tracing through a fully relativistic exact solution of the Einstein Field Equations which consists of randomly packed mass-compensated under-densities of realistic amplitudes. We find that one needs to include lens-lens coupling terms and post-Born corrections at least up to second and third order respectively for sub-percent accuracy of the convergence and angular diameter distance d\_A. We find that, out of the random lines of sight studied, post-Born corrections can be as large as 70\% of the total correction to the area distance. We also provide a simplified operator formalism for calculating the leading corrections to these quantities to arbitrary order.},

@article{mortonson_dark_2013,
	Abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. In this short review, we briefly summarize theories for the origin of cosmic acceleration and the observational methods being used to test these theories. We then discuss the current observational state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}), baryon acoustic oscillations ({BAO}), Type Ia supernovae ({SN}), direct measurements of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$), and measurements of galaxy and matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with a constant equation-of-state parameter \$w = P/{\textbackslash}rho\$, the combination of Planck {CMB} temperature anisotropies, {WMAP} {CMB} polarization, the Union2.1 {SN} compilation, and a compilation of {BAO} measurements yields \$w = -1.10{\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.07\}\$, consistent with a cosmological constant (\$w=-1\$). However, with these constraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of \$H\_0\$ that is lower than several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter combination \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8({\textbackslash}Omega\_m){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}\$ that is higher than many estimates from weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space distortions. Individually these tensions are only significant at the {\textasciitilde}\$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level, but they arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct sources of systematic uncertainty. The tensions are stronger with Planck {CMB} data than they were with {WMAP} because of the smaller statistical errors and the higher central value of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m.\$ With the improved measurements expected from the next generation of data sets, these tensions may diminish, or they may sharpen in a way that points towards a more complete physical understanding of cosmic acceleration.},

	Abstract = {We provide generic predictions for the lower order cumulants of weak lensing maps, and their correlators for tomographic bins as well as in three dimensions (3D). Using small-angle approximation, we derive the corresponding one- and two-point probability distribution function for the tomographic maps from different bins and for 3D convergence maps. The modelling of weak lensing statistics is obtained by adopting a detailed prescription for the underlying density contrast that involves hierarchal ansatz and lognormal distribution. We study the dependence of our results on cosmological parameters and source distributions
corresponding to the realistic surveys such as {LSST} and {DES}. We briefly outline how photometric redshift information can be incorporated in our results. We also show how topological properties of convergence maps can be quantified using our results.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising cosmological probes to constrain dark matter, dark energy and the nature of gravity at cosmic scales. Intrinsic alignments ({IA}) of galaxies have been recognized as one of the most serious systematic effects facing gravitational lensing. Such alignments must be isolated and removed to obtain a pure lensing signal. Furthermore, the alignments are related to the processes of galaxy formation, so their extracted signal can help in understanding such formation processes and improving their theoretical modeling. We report in this letter the first detection of the gravitational shear--intrinsic shape ({GI}) correlation and the intrinsic shape--galaxy density (Ig) correlation in a photometric redshift survey using the self-calibration method. These direct measurements are made from the {KiDS}-450 photometric galaxy survey with a significance of 2.74\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ in the third bin for the Ig correlation, and 2.73\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ for the {GI} cross-correlation between the third and fourth bins. The self-calibration method uses the information available from photometric surveys without needing to specify an {IA} model and will play an important role in validating {IA} models and {IA} mitigation in future surveys such as {LSST}, Euclid and {WFIRST}.},

	Abstract = {Forecasts in cosmology, both with Monte-Carlo Markov-chain methods and with the Fisher matrix formalism, depend on the choice of the fiducial model because both the signal strength of any observable as well as the model nonlinearities linking observables to cosmological parameters vary in the general case. In this paper we propose a method for extrapolating Fisher-forecasts across the space of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable ba- sis. We demonstrate the validity of our method with constraints on a standard dark energy model extrapolated from a \{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}{CDM}-model, as can be expected from 2-bin weak lensing to- mography with a Euclid-like survey, in the parameter pairs \$({\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}text\{m\},{\textbackslash}sigma\_8)\$, \$({\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}text\{m\}, w\_0)\$ and \$(w\_0, w\_{\textbackslash}text\{a\})\$. Our numerical results include very accurate extrapolations across a wide range of cosmo- logical parameters in terms of shape, size and orientation of the parameter likelihood, and a decomposition of the change of the likelihood contours into modes, which are straightforward to interpret in a geometrical way. We find that in particular the variation of the dark energy figure of merit is well captured by our formalism.},

@article{schmitz_time_2018,
	Abstract = {Intrinsic alignments ({IA}), correlations between the intrinsic shapes and orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus especially important to model {IA} with high accuracy. Efforts to use cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of {IA} on the large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of {IA}, because galaxy positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the epoch when {IA} is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy {IA} from the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a dependence of {IA} on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-{IA} bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved {IA} coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the degree of nonlocality represents the memory of a galaxy's path from the time of its formation to the time of observation. We discuss how this result can be used to constrain the redshift at which {IA} is determined and provide Fisher estimation for the relevant measurements using the example of {SDSS}-{BOSS}.},

@article{takada_power_2013,
	Abstract = {We provide a simple, unified approach to describing the impact of super-sample covariance, or beat coupling, on power spectrum estimation in a finite-volume survey. For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

	Abstract = {We perform high resolution ray-tracing simulations to investigate probability distribution functions ({PDFs}) of lensing convergence, shear, and magnification on distant sources up to the redshift of \$z\_s=20\$. We pay particular attention to the shot noise effect in \$N\$-body simulations by explicitly showing how it affects the variance of the convergence. We show that the convergence and magnification {PDFs} are closely related with each other via the approximate relation \${\textbackslash}mu=(1-{\textbackslash}kappa){\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, which can reproduce the behavior of {PDFs} surprisingly well up to the high magnification tail. The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance. We provide simple analytical formulae for the {PDFs}, which reproduce simulated {PDFs} reasonably well for a wide range of redshifts and smoothing sizes. As explicit applications of our ray-tracing simulations, we examine the strong lensing probability and the magnification effects on the luminosity functions of distant galaxies and quasars.},

@article{troxel_intrinsic_2015,
	Abstract = {The wealth of incoming and future cosmological observations will allow us to map out the structure and evolution of the observable universe to an unprecedented level of precision. Among these observations is the weak gravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g., cosmic shear that measures the minute distortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak lensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of structure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales. However, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies -- their shape and orientation before being lensed -- may pose a great challenge to the use of weak gravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been identified as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear studies. Correlations between this intrinsic alignment and the lensing signal can persist even for large physical separations, and isolating the effect of intrinsic alignment from weak lensing is not trivial. A great deal of work in the last two decades has been devoted to understanding and characterizing this intrinsic alignment, which is also a direct and complementary probe of structure formation and evolution in its own right. In this review, we report in a systematic way the state of our understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, with a particular emphasis on its large-scale impact on weak lensing measurements and methods for its isolation or mitigation.

@article{valageas_statistical_1999,
	Abstract = {Density fluctuations in the matter distribution lead to distortions of the images of distant galaxies through weak gravitational lensing effects. This provides an efficient probe of the cosmological parameters and of the density field. In this article, we investigate the statistical properties of the convergence due to weak gravitational lensing by non-linear structures (i.e. we consider small angular windows \${\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}la 1'\$). Previous studies have shown how to relate the second and third order moments of the convergence to those of the density contrast while models based on the Press-Schechter prescription provide an estimate of the tail of \$P({\textbackslash}kappa)\$. Here we present a method to obtain an estimate of the full p.d.f. of the convergence \$P({\textbackslash}kappa)\$. It is based on a realistic description of the density field which applies to overdense as well as underdense regions. We show that our predictions agree very well with the results of N-body simulations for the convergence. This could allow one to derive the cosmological parameters \$({\textbackslash}Omega\_m,{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\})\$ as well as the full p.d.f. \$P({\textbackslash}delta\_R)\$ of the density contrast itself in the non-linear regime from observations. Hence this gives a very powerfull tool to constrain scenarios of structure formation.},

	Abstract = {Given recent indications of additional neutrino species and cosmologically significant neutrino masses, we analyze their signatures in the weak lensing shear power spectrum. We find that a shear deficit in the 20-40\% range or excess in the 20-60\% range cannot be explained by variations in parameters of the flat {LambdaCDM} model that are allowed by current observations of the expansion history from Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and local measures of the Hubble constant H\_0, coupled with observations of the cosmic microwave background from {WMAP}9 and the {SPT} 2500 square degree survey. Hence such a shear deficit or excess would indicate large masses or extra species, respectively, and we find this to be independent of the flatness assumption. We also discuss the robustness of these predictions to cosmic acceleration physics and the means by which shear degeneracies in joint variation of mass and species can be broken.},

	Abstract = {Any theory invoked to explain cosmic acceleration predicts consistency relations between the expansion history, structure growth, and all related observables. Currently there exist high-quality measurements of the expansion history from Type Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization spectra, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We can use constraints from these datasets to predict what future probes of structure growth should observe. We apply this method to predict what range of cosmic shear power spectra would be expected if we lived in a {LambdaCDM} universe, with or without spatial curvature, and what results would be inconsistent and therefore falsify the model. Though predictions are relaxed if one allows for an arbitrary quintessence equation of state \$-1{\textbackslash}le w(z){\textbackslash}le 1\$, we find that any observation that rules out {LambdaCDM} due to excess lensing will also rule out all quintessence models, with or without early dark energy. We further explore how uncertainties in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, e.g. from approximate fitting formulas such as Halofit, warm dark matter, or baryons, impact these limits.},

@article{yu_fast_2016,
	Abstract = {To take full advantage of the unprecedented power of upcoming weak lensing surveys, understanding the noise, such as cosmic variance and geometry/mask effects, is as important as understanding the signal itself. Accurately quantifying the noise requires a large number of statistically independent mocks for a variety of cosmologies. This is impractical for weak lensing simulations, which are costly for simultaneous requirements of large box size (to cover a significant fraction of the past light cone) and high resolution (to robustly probe the small scale where most lensing signal resides). Therefore fast mock generation methods are desired and are under intensive investigation. We propose a new fast weak lensing map generation method, named the inverse-Gaussianization method, based on the finding that a lensing convergence field can be Gaussianized to excellent accuracy by a local transformation [Yu et al, Phys. Rev. D 84, 023523 (2011)]. Given a simulation, it enables us to produce as many as infinite statistically independent lensing maps as fast as producing the simulation initial conditions. The proposed method is tested against simulations for each tomography bin centered at lens redshift \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$, 1, and 2, with various statistics. We find that the lensing maps generated by our method have reasonably accurate power spectra, bispectra, and power spectrum covariance matrix. Therefore, it will be useful for weak lensing surveys to generate realistic mocks. As an example of application, we measure the probability distribution function of the lensing power spectrum, from 16384 lensing maps produced by the inverse-Gaussianization method.},

	Abstract = {Weak lensing surveys provide a powerful probe of dark energy through the measurement of the mass distribution of the local Universe. A number of ground-based and space-based surveys are being planned for this purpose. Here, we study the optimal strategy for these future surveys using the joint constraints on the equation of state parameter wn and its evolution wa as a figure of merit by considering power spectrum tomography. For this purpose, we first consider an `ideal' survey which is both wide and deep and exempt from systematics. We find that such a survey has great potential for dark energy studies, reaching one sigma precisions of 1\% and 10\% on the two parameters respectively. We then study the relative impact of various limitations by degrading this ideal survey. In particular, we consider the effect of sky coverage, survey depth, shape measurements systematics, photometric redshifts systematics and uncertainties in the non-linear power spectrum predictions. We find that, for a given observing time, it is always advantageous to choose a wide rather than a deep survey geometry. We also find that the dark energy constraints from power spectrum tomography are robust to photometric redshift errors and catastrophic failures, if a spectroscopic calibration sample of 10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}5 galaxies is available. The impact of these systematics is small compared to the limitations that come from potential uncertainties in the power spectrum, due to shear measurement and theoretical errors. To help the planning of future surveys, we summarize our results with comprehensive scaling relations which avoid the need for full Fisher matrix calculations.},

@article{blazek_beyond_2017,
	Abstract = {Galaxy intrinsic alignments ({IA}) are a critical uncertainty for current and future weak lensing measurements. We describe a perturbative expansion of {IA}, analogous to the treatment of galaxy biasing. From an astrophysical perspective, this model includes the expected large-scale alignment mechanisms for galaxies that are pressure-supported (tidal alignment) and rotation-supported (tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between the two. Alternatively, this expansion can be viewed as an effective model capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include terms up to second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting {IA} contributions to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial amplitudes of the {IA} parameters, we find the quadratic alignment and linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections to the total intrinsic alignment signal at \$k{\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textbackslash},h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$, depending on the source redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant biases on inferred cosmological parameters in Stage {IV} photometric weak lensing surveys. We perform forecasts for an {LSST}-like survey, finding that use of the standard "{NLA}" model for intrinsic alignments cannot remove these large parameter biases, even when allowing for a more general redshift dependence. The model presented here will allow for more accurate and flexible {IA} treatment in weak lensing and combined probes analyses, and an implementation is made available as part of the public {FAST}-{PT} code. The model also provides a more advanced framework for understanding the underlying {IA} processes and their relationship to fundamental physics.},

	Abstract = {Forthcoming experiments will enable us to determine tomographic shear spectra at a high precision level. Most predictions about them have until now been biased on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum of density fluctuations. Even when simulations have been used, so-called Halofit (Smith et al 2003) predictions on fairly large scales have been needed. We wish to go beyond this limitation. We perform N-body and hydrodynamical simulations within a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connection between simulations and linear spectra. While covering large length-scales, the simulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-l harmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l {\textasciitilde} 50000), well into the domain where baryon physics becomes important. We then compare shear spectra in the absence and in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. We distinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in the different simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. We compare our outputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linear spectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results and those of purely N-body results. Our simulations and the treatment of their outputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht are fully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range, where we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of density perturbations, and the effects of baryon physics. This will allow us to fully exploit the cosmological information contained in future high--sensitivity cosmic shear surveys, exploring the physics of cosmic shears via weak lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {We construct the largest curved-sky galaxy weak lensing mass map to date from the {DES} first-year ({DES} Y1) data. The map, about 10 times larger than previous work, is constructed over a contiguous \${\textbackslash}approx1,500 \$deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$, covering a comoving volume of \${\textbackslash}approx10 \$Gpc\${\textasciicircum}3\$. The effects of masking, sampling, and noise are tested using simulations. We generate weak lensing maps from two {DES} Y1 shear catalogs, Metacalibration and Im3shape, with sources at redshift \$0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.3,\$ and in each of four bins in this range. In the highest signal-to-noise map, the ratio between the mean signal-to-noise in the E-mode and the B-mode map is \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.5 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2) when smoothed with a Gaussian filter of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{G\}=30\$ (80) arcminutes. The second and third moments of the convergence \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ in the maps are in agreement with simulations. We also find no significant correlation of \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ with maps of potential systematic contaminants. Finally, we demonstrate two applications of the mass maps: (1) cross-correlation with different foreground tracers of mass and (2) exploration of the largest peaks and voids in the maps.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters that govern them. The nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure produces a non-Gaussian signal that is potentially observable in galaxy shear data. We study the three-point statistics of the convergence, specifically the bispectrum, using the dark matter halo approach, which describes the density field in terms of correlations between and within dark matter halos. Our approach allows us to study the effect of the mass distribution in observed fields, in particular the bias induced by the lack of rare massive halos (clusters) in observed fields. We show that the convergence skewness is primarily due to rare and massive dark matter halos, with skewness converging to its mean value only if halos of mass M {\textgreater} 10 15 M ☉ are present. This calculational method can in principle be used to correct for such a bias as well as to search for more robust statistics related to the two- and three-point correlations.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the non-Gaussian contribution to the power spectrum covariance of cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) anisotropies resulting through weak gravitational lensing angular deflections and the correlation of deflections with secondary sources of temperature fluctuations generated by the large scale structure, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and the Sunyave-Zel'dovich effect. This additional contribution to the covariance of binned angular power spectrum, beyond the well known cosmic variance and any associated instrumental noise, results from a trispectrum, or a four point correlation function, in temperature anisotropy data. With substantially wide bins in multipole space, the resulting non-Gaussian contribution from lensing to the binned power spectrum variance is insignificant out to multipoles of a few thousand and is not likely to affect the cosmological parameter estimation through acoustic peaks and the damping tail. The non-Gaussian contribution to covariance, however, should be considered when interpreting binned {CMB} power spectrum measurements at multipoles of a few thousand corresponding to angular scales of few arcminutes and less.},

@article{douspis_tension_2019,
	Abstract = {Recent years have brought strong observational evidences for the standard {LCDM} cosmological model. Cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) anisotropy and large scale structure ({LSS}) probes do not favour any extensions of the standard model. Nevertheless, in this framework, the preferred cosmological parameters may differ from probe to probe, from experiment to experiment. This is the well known case of the tension between {CMB} and Sunyaev Zel'dovich ({SZ}) galaxy clusters ({GC}) from Planck. In 2013, the Planck team has shown that the preferred matter content (\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}M) and density fluctuation power spectrum amplitude (\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}8), the two main cosmological parameters probed by the galaxy cluster number count, are different in the {CMB} analyses and in the {SZ} cluster analyses at more than 2 sigmas (a result confirmed in subsequent analyses). We present the results of our new analysis using more recent measurements of the {CMB}, {SZ} clusters and {SZ} power spectrum of 2016 and show that the tension on (\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}M,\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}8) is mostly releaved. The lower value of the reionisation optical depth and thus of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}8 in the recent Planck studies is the main reason. We also show that basic extensions of the standard model (massive neutrinos or non-lambda dark energy) do not help improving the agreement between the probes. In order to fully reconcile {SZ} clusters with {CMB} best model, the mass of the galaxy clusters derived from hydrostatic equilibrium should be 40\% lower than the true mass. While current numerical simulations and weak lensing measurements agree for a mass bias of 20\%, investigations are still going on to explain such disagreement on the mass bias. We show that considering a mass bias evolving with redshift or mass does not help in eliminating the discrepancy.},

@article{grandis_information_2016,
	Abstract = {In light of the growing number of cosmological observations, it is important to develop versatile tools to quantify the constraining power and consistency of cosmological probes. Originally motivated from information theory, we use the relative entropy to compute the information gained by Bayesian updates in units of bits. This measure quantifies both the improvement in precision and the 'surprise', i.e. the tension arising from shifts in central values. Our starting point is a {WMAP}9 prior which we update with observations of the distance ladder, supernovae ({SNe}), baryon acoustic oscillations ({BAO}), and weak lensing as well as the 2015 Planck release. We consider the parameters of the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} concordance model and some of its extensions which include curvature and Dark Energy equation of state parameter \$w\$. We find that, relative to {WMAP}9 and within these model spaces, the probes that have provided the greatest gains are Planck (10 bits), followed by {BAO} surveys (5.1 bits) and {SNe} experiments (3.1 bits). The other cosmological probes, including weak lensing (1.7 bits) and \{\${\textbackslash}rm H\_0\$\} measures (1.7 bits), have contributed information but at a lower level. Furthermore, we do not find any significant surprise when updating the constraints of {WMAP}9 with any of the other experiments, meaning that they are consistent with {WMAP}9. However, when we choose Planck15 as the prior, we find that, accounting for the full multi-dimensionality of the parameter space, the weak lensing measurements of {CFHTLenS} produce a large surprise of 4.4 bits which is statistically significant at the 8 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. We discuss how the relative entropy provides a versatile and robust framework to compare cosmological probes in the context of current and future surveys.},

@article{heavens_combining_2013,
	Abstract = {Weak lensing alters the size of images with a similar magnitude to the distortion due to shear. Galaxy size probes the convergence field, and shape the shear field, both of which contain cosmological information. We show the gains expected in the Dark Energy Figure of Merit if galaxy size information is used in combination with galaxy shape. In any normal analysis of cosmic shear, galaxy sizes are also studied, so this is extra statistical information comes for free and is currently unused. There are two main results in this letter: firstly, we show that size measurement can be made uncorrelated with ellipticity measurement, thus allowing the full statistical gain from the combination, provided that \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{Area\}\$ is used as a size indicator; secondly, as a proof of concept, we show that when the relevant modes are noise-dominated, as is the norm for lensing surveys, the gains are substantial, with improvements of about 68\% in the Figure of Merit expected when systematic errors are ignored. An approximate treatment of such systematics such as intrinsic alignments and size-magnitude correlations respectively suggests that a much better improvement in the Dark Energy Figure of Merit of even a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 may be achieved.},

@article{hilbert_cosmic_2011,
	Abstract = {[Abridged] We seek approximations to the cosmic shear covariance that are as easy to use as the common approximations based on normal statistics, but yield more accurate covariance matrices and parameter errors. We derive expressions for the cosmic shear covariance under the assumption that the underlying convergence field follows log-normal statistics. We also derive a simplified version of this log-normal approximation. We use numerical simulations of weak lensing to study how well the normal, log-normal, and simplified log-normal approximations as well as empirical corrections to the normal approximation proposed in the literature reproduce shear covariances for cosmic shear surveys. We find that the normal approximation substantially underestimates the cosmic shear covariances and the inferred parameter confidence regions, in particular for surveys with small fields of view and large galaxy densities, but also for very wide surveys. In contrast, the log-normal approximation yields more realistic covariances and confidence regions, but also requires evaluating slightly more complicated expressions. However, the simplified log-normal approximation, although as simple as the normal approximation, yields confidence regions that are almost as accurate as those obtained from the log-normal approximation. The empirical corrections to the normal approximation do not yield more accurate covariances and confidence regions than the (simplified) log-normal approximation. Moreover, they fail to produce positive-semidefinite data covariance matrices in certain cases, rendering them unusable for parameter estimation. The simplified log-normal approximation should be used in favour of the normal approximation for parameter estimation and parameter error forecasts. Any approximation to the cosmic shear covariance should ensure a positive-semidefinite data covariance matrix.},

@article{huff_magnificent_2011,
	Abstract = {We describe a new method for measuring galaxy magnification due to weak gravitational lensing. Our method makes use of a tight scaling relation between galaxy properties that are modified by gravitational lensing, such as apparent size, and other properties that are not, such as surface brightness. In particular, we use a version of the well-known fundamental plane relation for early type galaxies. This modified "photometric fundamental plane" replaces velocity dispersions with photometric galaxy properties, thus obviating the need for spectroscopic data. We present the first detection of magnification using this method by applying it to photometric catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This analysis shows that the derived magnification signal is comparable to that available from conventional methods using gravitational shear. We suppress the dominant sources of systematic error and discuss modest improvements that may allow this method to equal or even surpass the signal-to-noise achievable with shear. Moreover, some of the dominant sources of systematic error are substantially different from those of shear-based techniques. Thus, combining the two techniques addresses the major weaknesses of each and provides a substantial improvement over either method used in isolation. With this new technique, magnification becomes a necessary measurement tool for the coming era of large ground-based surveys intending to measure gravitational lensing.},

We explore these relationships down to halos of much lower mass (10{\textasciicircum}11/h Msun) than previous studies. The halos are triaxial, with c/a ratios of 0.6+-0.1. More massive halos are more flattened. The principal axes are very well aligned within 0.6 r\_vir. The angular momentum vectors are also reasonably well aligned except between the very outermost and very innermost regions of the halo. The angular momentum vectors tend to align with the minor axes, with a mean misalignment of {\textasciitilde}25 degrees, and lie perpendicular to the major and intermediate axes. The properties of a halo at 0.4 r\_vir are quite characteristic of the properties at most other radii within the halo. There is a very strong tendency for the minor axes of halos to lie perpendicular to large scale filaments. This alignment extends to much larger separations for group and cluster mass halos than for galaxy mass halos. As a consequence, the intrinsic alignments of galaxies are likely weaker than previous predictions, which were based on the shapes of cluster mass halos. The angular momenta of the highest concentration halos tend to point toward other halos. The angular momenta of galaxy mass halos point parallel to filaments, while those of group and cluster mass halos show a very strong tendency to point perpendicular to the filaments. This suggests that group and cluster mass halos acquire most of their angular momentum from major mergers along filaments, while the accretion history of mass and angular momentum onto galaxy mass halos has been smoother.},

@article{pahwa_alignment_2016,
	Abstract = {Tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in the linear stage of structure formation. Such a theory predicts alignments between the spin of haloes and tidal shear field. However, non-linear evolution and angular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. In this paper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiar velocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within \$115{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\} \$ (\${\textbackslash}sim8000 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{km\}\}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) from 2MRS catalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes of shear field. Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at similar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments with velocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2MRS sample, show a statistically significant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. In general, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of greatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression. Spiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened when considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field reconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis of greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result indicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly noisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strong enough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered - especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {An analysis by Doroshkevich (1970) which shows that the angular momentum of galaxies grew to first order (in proportion to t) during the linear phases of protogalactic evolution is expanded. This result is confirmed in N-body simulations of the formation of structure. The well-known study of Peebles (1969) found growth at second order only (in proportion to t to the 5/3-power) because its analysis was restricted to spherical regions. In such regions growth occurs purely as a result of convective effects on the bounding surface; the material initially within a spherical volume gains no angular momentum in second-order perturbation theory. These considerations do not affect estimates of the total angular momentum acquired by a galaxy in the gravitational instability picture.},

@article{bate_when_2019,
	Abstract = {Elliptical galaxies today appear aligned with the large-scale structure of the Universe, but it is still an open question when they acquire this alignment. Observational data is currently insufficient to provide constraints on the time evolution of intrinsic alignments, and hence existing models range from assuming that galaxies gain some primordial alignment at formation, to suggesting that they react instantaneously to tidal interactions with the large-scale structure. Using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-{AGN}, we measure the relative alignments between the major axes of galaxies and eigenvectors of the tidal field as a function of redshift. We focus on constraining the time evolution of the alignment of the main progenitors of massive \$z=0\$ elliptical galaxies, the main weak lensing contaminant at low redshift. We show that this population, which at \$z=0\$ has a stellar mass above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.4\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, transitions from having no alignment with the tidal field at \$z=3\$, to a significant alignment by \$z=1\$. From \$z=0.5\$ they preserve their alignment at an approximately constant level until \$z=0\$. We find a mass-dependence of the alignment signal of elliptical progenitors, whereby ellipticals that are less massive today (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.4\}{\textless}M/\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{10.7\}\$) do not become aligned till later redshifts (\$z{\textless}2\$), compared to more massive counterparts. We also present an extended study of progenitor alignments in the parameter space of stellar mass and galaxy dynamics, the impact of shape definition and tidal field smoothing.},

@article{chisari_contamination_2015,
	Abstract = {Galaxy shapes are subject to distortions due to the tidal field of the Universe. The cross-correlation of galaxy lensing with the lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB}) cannot easily be separated from the cross-correlation of galaxy intrinsic shapes with {CMB} lensing. Previous work suggested that the intrinsic alignment contamination can be \$15{\textbackslash}\%\$ of this cross-spectrum for the {CFHT} Stripe 82 ({CS}82) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope surveys. Here we re-examine these estimates using up-to-date observational constraints of intrinsic alignments at a redshift more similar to that of {CS}82 galaxies. We find a \${\textbackslash}approx\$ \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ contamination of the cross-spectrum from red galaxies, with \${\textbackslash}approx\$ \$3{\textbackslash}\%\$ uncertainty due to uncertainties in the redshift distribution of source galaxies and the modelling of the spectral energy distribution. Blue galaxies are consistent with being unaligned, but could contaminate the cross-spectrum by an additional \$9.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ within current \$95{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence levels. While our fiducial estimate of alignment contamination is similar to previous work, our work suggests that the relevance of alignments for {CMB} lensing-galaxy lensing cross-correlation remains largely unconstrained. Little information is currently available about alignments at \$z{\textgreater}1.2\$. We consider the upper limiting case where all \$z{\textgreater}1.2\$ galaxies are aligned with the same strength as low redshift luminous red galaxies, finding as much as \${\textbackslash}approx\$ \$60{\textbackslash}\%\$ contamination.},

	Abstract = {The intrinsic alignments of galaxies are recognised as a contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements. In this work, we study the alignment of galaxy shapes and spins at low redshift (z{\textasciitilde}0.5) in Horizon-{AGN}, an adaptive-mesh-refinement hydrodynamical cosmological simulation box of 100 Mpc/h a side with {AGN} feedback implementation. We find that spheroidal galaxies in the simulation show a tendency to be aligned radially towards over-densities in the dark matter density field and other spheroidals. This trend is in agreement with observations, but the amplitude of the signal depends strongly on how shapes are measured and how galaxies are selected in the simulation. Disc galaxies show a tendency to be oriented tangentially around spheroidals in three-dimensions. While this signal seems suppressed in projection, this does not guarantee that disc alignments can be safely ignored in future weak lensing surveys. The shape alignments of luminous galaxies in Horizon-{AGN} are in agreement with observations and other simulation works, but we find less alignment for lower luminosity populations. We also characterize the systematics of galaxy shapes in the simulation and show that they can be safely neglected when measuring the correlation of the density field and galaxy ellipticities.},

@article{chisari_redshift_2016,
	Abstract = {Intrinsic galaxy shape and angular momentum alignments can arise in cosmological large-scale structure due to tidal interactions or galaxy formation processes. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have recently come of age as a tool to study these alignments and their contamination to weak gravitational lensing. We probe the redshift and luminosity evolution of intrinsic alignments in Horizon-{AGN} between z=0 and z=3 for galaxies with an r-band absolute magnitude of {\textless}-20. Alignments transition from being radial at low redshifts and high luminosities, dominated by the contribution of ellipticals, to being tangential at high redshift and low luminosities, where discs dominate the signal. This cannot be explained by the evolution of the fraction of ellipticals and discs alone: intrinsic evolution in the amplitude of alignments is necessary. The alignment amplitude of elliptical galaxies alone is smaller in amplitude by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2, but has similar luminosity and redshift evolution as in current observations and in the nonlinear tidal alignment model at projected separations of {\textgreater} 1 Mpc. Alignments of discs are null in projection and consistent with current low redshift observations. The combination of the two populations yields an overall amplitude a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 lower than observed alignments of luminous red galaxies with a steeper luminosity dependence. The restriction on accurate galaxy shapes implies that the galaxy population in the simulation is complete only to an r-band absolute magnitude of {\textless}-20. Higher resolution simulations will be necessary to avoid extrapolation of the intrinsic alignment predictions to the range of luminosities probed by future surveys.},

@article{codis_galaxy_2018,
	Abstract = {This work investigates the alignment of galactic spins with the cosmic web across cosmic time using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-{AGN}. The cosmic web structure is extracted via the persistent skeleton as implemented in the {DISPERSE} algorithm. It is found that the spin of low-mass galaxies is more likely to be aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web and to lie within the plane of the walls while more massive galaxies tend to have a spin perpendicular to the axis of the filaments and to the walls. The mass transition is detected with a significance of 9 sigmas. This galactic alignment is consistent with the alignment of the spin of dark haloes found in pure dark matter simulations and with predictions from (anisotropic) tidal torque theory. However, unlike haloes, the alignment of low-mass galaxies is weak and disappears at low redshifts while the orthogonal spin orientation of massive galaxies is strong and increases with time, probably as a result of mergers. At fixed mass, alignments are correlated with galaxy morphology: the high-redshift alignment is dominated by spiral galaxies while elliptical centrals are mainly responsible for the perpendicular signal. These predictions for spin alignments with respect to cosmic filaments and unprecendently walls are successfully compared with existing observations. The alignment of the shape of galaxies with the different components of the cosmic web is also investigated. A coherent and stronger signal is found in terms of shape at high mass. The two regimes probed in this work induce competing galactic alignment signals for weak lensing, with opposite redshift and luminosity evolution. Understanding the details of these intrinsic alignments will be key to exploit future major cosmic shear surveys like Euclid or {LSST}.},

	Abstract = {The intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes (by means of their angular momentum) and their cross-correlation with the surrounding dark matter tidal field are investigated using the 160 000, z=1.2 synthetic galaxies extracted from the high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-{AGN}. One- and two-point statistics of the spin of the stellar component are measured as a function of mass and colour. For the low-mass galaxies, this spin is locally aligned with the tidal field `filamentary' direction while, for the high-mass galaxies, it is perpendicular to both filaments and walls. The bluest galaxies of our synthetic catalog are more strongly correlated with the surrounding tidal field than the reddest galaxies, and this correlation extends up to 10 Mpc/h comoving distance. We also report a correlation of the projected ellipticities of blue, intermediate mass galaxies on a similar scale at a level of 10{\textasciicircum}(-4) which could be a concern for cosmic shear measurements. We do not report any measurable intrinsic alignments of the reddest galaxies of our sample. This work is a first step toward the use of very realistic catalog of synthetic galaxies to evaluate the contamination of weak lensing measurement by the intrinsic galactic alignments.},

@article{codis_spin_2015,
	Abstract = {The geometry of the cosmic web drives in part the spin acquisition of galaxies. This can be explained in a Lagrangian framework, by identifying the specific long-wavelength correlations within the primordial Gaussian random field which are relevant to spin acquisition. Tidal Torque Theory is revisited in the context of such anisotropic environments, biased by the presence of a filament within a wall. The point process of filament-type saddles represents it most efficiently. The constrained misalignment between the tidal and the inertia tensors in the vicinity of filament-type saddles simply explains the distribution of spin directions. This misalignment implies in particular an azimuthal orientation for the spins of more massive galaxies and a spin alignment with the filament for less massive galaxies. This prediction is found to be in qualitative agreement with measurements in Gaussian random fields and N-body simulations. It relates the transition mass to the geometry of the saddle, and accordingly predicts its measured scaling with the mass of non-linearity. Implications for galaxy formation and weak lensing are briefly discussed, as is the dual theory of spin alignments in walls.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological perturbation theory is a powerful tool to predict the statistics of large-scale structure in the weakly non-linear regime, but even at 1-loop order it results in computationally expensive mode-coupling integrals. Here we present a fast algorithm for computing 1-loop power spectra of quantities that depend on the observer's orientation, thereby generalizing the {FAST}-{PT} framework ({McEwen} et al., 2016) that was originally developed for scalars such as the matter density. This algorithm works for an arbitrary input power spectrum and substantially reduces the time required for numerical evaluation. We apply the algorithm to four examples: intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the tidal torque model; the Ostriker-Vishniac effect; the secondary {CMB} polarization due to baryon flows; and the 1-loop matter power spectrum in redshift space. Code implementing this algorithm and these applications is publicly available at https://github.com/{JoeMcEwen}/{FAST}-{PT} .},

	Abstract = {To accomplish correct Bayesian inference from weak lensing shear data requires a complete statistical description of the data. The natural framework to do this is a Bayesian Hierarchical Model, which divides the chain of reasoning into component steps. Starting with a catalogue of shear estimates in tomographic bins, we build a model that allows us to sample simultaneously from the the underlying tomographic shear fields and the relevant power spectra (E-mode, B-mode, and E-B, for auto- and cross-power spectra). The procedure deals easily with masked data and intrinsic alignments. Using Gibbs sampling and messenger fields, we show with simulated data that the large (over 67000-)dimensional parameter space can be efficiently sampled and the full joint posterior probability density function for the parameters can feasibly be obtained. The method correctly recovers the underlying shear fields and all of the power spectra, including at levels well below the shot noise.},

	Abstract = {We study intrinsic alignments ({IA}) of galaxy image shapes within the Illustris cosmic structure formation simulations. We investigate how {IA} correlations depend on observable galaxy properties such as stellar mass, apparent magnitude, redshift, and photometric type, and on the employed shape measurement method. The correlations considered include the matter density-intrinsic ellipticity ({mI}), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity ({dI}), gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity ({GI}), and intrinsic ellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity ({II}) correlations. We find stronger correlations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for earlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, shape measurement methods that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much weaker {IA} signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat radial weights. Thus, the expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the observed ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be below one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the details of the shape measurement method. A comparison of our results to a tidal alignment model indicates that such a model is able to reproduce the {IA} correlations well on intermediate and large scales, provided the effect of varying galaxy density is correctly taken into account. We also find that the {GI} contributions to the observed ellipticity correlations could be inferred directly from measurements of galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity correlations, except on small scales, where systematic differences between {mI} and {dI} correlations are large.},

@article{hirata_intrinsic_2010,
	Abstract = {Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic ({GI}) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic ({II}) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the {GI} correlation term can exceed the usual {II} term by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of order {\textasciitilde}10\% at z\_s=1 and {\textasciitilde}30\% at z\_s=0.5.},

	Abstract = {We present a tomographic cosmic shear study from the Deep Lens Survey ({DLS}), which, providing a limiting magnitude r\_\{lim\}{\textasciitilde}27 (5 sigma), is designed as a pre-cursor Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) survey with an emphasis on depth. Using five tomographic redshift bins, we study their auto- and cross-correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. We use a luminosity-dependent nonlinear model to account for the astrophysical systematics originating from intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes. We find that the cosmological leverage of the {DLS} is among the highest among existing {\textgreater}10 sq. deg cosmic shear surveys. Combining the {DLS} tomography with the 9-year results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ({WMAP}9) gives Omega\_m=0.293\_\{-0.014\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.012\}, sigma\_8=0.833\_\{-0.018\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.011\}, H\_0=68.6\_\{-1.2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\} km/s/Mpc, and Omega\_b=0.0475+-0.0012 for {LCDM}, reducing the uncertainties of the {WMAP}9-only constraints by {\textasciitilde}50\%. When we do not assume flatness for {LCDM}, we obtain the curvature constraint Omega\_k=-0.010\_\{-0.015\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.013\} from the {DLS}+{WMAP}9 combination, which however is not well constrained when {WMAP}9 is used alone. The dark energy equation of state parameter w is tightly constrained when Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation ({BAO}) data are added, yielding w=-1.02\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\} with the {DLS}+{WMAP}9+{BAO} joint probe. The addition of supernova constraints further tightens the parameter to w=-1.03+-0.03. Our joint constraints are fully consistent with the final Planck results and also the predictions of a {LCDM} universe.},

	Abstract = {We directly constrain the non-linear alignment ({NLA}) model of intrinsic galaxy alignments, analysing the most representative and complete flux-limited sample of spectroscopic galaxies available for cosmic shear surveys. We measure the projected galaxy position-intrinsic shear correlations and the projected galaxy clustering signal using high-resolution imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey ({KiDS}) overlapping with the {GAMA} spectroscopic survey, and data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Separating samples by colour, we make no significant detection of blue galaxy alignments, constraining the blue galaxy {NLA} amplitude \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{{IA}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{B\}\}=0.23{\textasciicircum}\{+0.39\}\_\{-0.37\}\$ to be consistent with zero. We make robust detections (\${\textbackslash}sim9{\textbackslash}sigma\$) for red galaxies, with \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{{IA}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{R\}\}=3.35{\textasciicircum}\{+0.50\}\_\{-0.50\}\$, corresponding to a net radial alignment with the galaxy density field. We provide informative priors for current and future weak lensing surveys, an improvement over de facto wide priors that allow for unrealistic levels of intrinsic alignment contamination. For a colour-split cosmic shear analysis of the final {KiDS} survey area, we forecast that our priors will improve the constraining power on \$S\_\{8\}\$ and the dark energy equation of state \$w\_\{0\}\$, by up to \$62{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$51{\textbackslash}\%\$, respectively. Our results indicate, however, that the modelling of red/blue-split galaxy alignments may be insufficient to describe samples with variable central/satellite galaxy fractions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of astrophysical systematics on cosmic shear cosmological parameter constraints from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey ({CFHTLenS}), and the concordance with cosmic microwave background measurements by Planck. We present updated {CFHTLenS} cosmic shear tomography measurements extended to degree scales using a covariance calibrated by a new suite of N-body simulations. We analyze these measurements with a new model fitting pipeline, accounting for key systematic uncertainties arising from intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic effects in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and photometric redshift uncertainties. We examine the impact of the systematic degrees of freedom on the cosmological parameter constraints, both independently and jointly. When the systematic uncertainties are considered independently, the intrinsic alignment amplitude is the only degree of freedom that is substantially preferred by the data. When the systematic uncertainties are considered jointly, there is no consistently strong preference in favor of the more complex models. We quantify the level of concordance between the {CFHTLenS} and Planck datasets by employing two distinct data concordance tests, grounded in Bayesian evidence and information theory. We find that the two data concordance tests largely agree with one another, and that the level of concordance between the {CFHTLenS} and Planck datasets is sensitive to the exact details of the systematic uncertainties included in our analysis, ranging from decisive discordance to substantial concordance as the treatment of the systematic uncertainties becomes more conservative. The least conservative scenario is the one most favored by the cosmic shear data, but it is also the one that shows the greatest degree of discordance with Planck.

	Abstract = {The shapes of galaxies are not randomly oriented on the sky. During the galaxy formation and evolution process, environment has a strong influence, as tidal gravitational fields in the large-scale structure tend to align nearby galaxies. Additionally, events such as galaxy mergers affect the relative alignments of both the shapes and angular momenta of galaxies throughout their history. These "intrinsic galaxy alignments" are known to exist, but are still poorly understood. This review will offer a pedagogical introduction to the current theories that describe intrinsic galaxy alignments, including the apparent difference in intrinsic alignment between early- and late-type galaxies and the latest efforts to model them analytically. It will then describe the ongoing efforts to simulate intrinsic alignments using both N-body and hydrodynamic simulations. Due to the relative youth of this field, there is still much to be done to understand intrinsic galaxy alignments and this review summarises the current state of the field, providing a solid basis for future work.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy shapes are not randomly oriented, rather they are statistically aligned in a way that can depend on formation environment, history and galaxy type. Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important information about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the growth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of intrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical mitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic alignments.},

@article{kirk_optimising_2011,
	Abstract = {We consider how upcoming photometric large scale structure surveys can be optimized to measure the properties of dark energy and possible cosmic scale modifications to General Relativity in light of realistic astrophysical and instrumental systematic uncertainities. In particular we include flexible descriptions of intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias and photometric redshift uncertainties in a Fisher Matrix analysis of shear, position and position-shear correlations, including complementary cosmological constraints from the {CMB}. We study the impact of survey tradeoffs in depth versus breadth, and redshift quality. We parameterise the results in terms of the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit, and deviations from General Relativity through an analagous Modified Gravity figure of merit. We find that intrinsic alignments weaken the dependence of figure of merit on area and that, for a fixed observing time, a fiducial Stage {IV} survey plateaus above roughly 10,000deg2 for {DE} and peaks at about 5,000deg2 as the relative importance of {IAs} at low redshift penalises wide, shallow surveys. While reducing photometric redshift scatter improves constraining power, the dependence is shallow. The variation in constraining power is stronger once {IAs} are included and is slightly more pronounced for {MG} constraints than for {DE}. The inclusion of intrinsic alignments and galaxy position information reduces the required prior on photometric redshift accuracy by an order of magnitude for both the fiducial Stage {III} and {IV} surveys, equivalent to a factor of 100 reduction in the number of spectroscopic galaxies required to calibrate the photometric sample.},

@article{larsen_intrinsic_2016,
	Abstract = {Correlations of galaxy ellipticities with large-scale structure, due to galactic tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to measurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still poorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear analyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant in determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we calculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model from non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate this to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured cross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the {CMB} lensing potential. On the scales relevant for {CMB} lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the gravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale mode that sources {CMB} lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the intrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular cross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in the linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies. The amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the formation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift when the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we make simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the correlation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current {CMB} lensing measurements. We note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in measurements of the difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and spiral galaxies if these can be separated (e.g., using colour).},

	Abstract = {Cross-correlating the lensing signals of galaxies and comic microwave background ({CMB}) fluctuations is expected to provide valuable cosmological information. In particular it may help tighten constraints on parameters describing the properties of intrinsically aligned galaxies at high redshift. To access the information conveyed by the cross-correlation signal its accurate theoretical description is required. We compute the bias to {CMB} lensing-galaxy shape cross-correlation measurements induced by nonlinear structure growth. Using tree-level perturbation theory for the large-scale structure bispectrum we find that the bias is negative on most angular scales, therefore mimicking the signal of intrinsic alignments. Combining Euclid-like galaxy lensing data with a {CMB} experiment comparable to the Planck satellite mission the bias becomes significant only on smallest scales (\${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}gtrsim 2500\$). For improved {CMB} observations, however, the corrections amount to 10-15 per cent of the {CMB} lensing-intrinsic alignment signal over a wide multipole range (\$10 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}lesssim 2000\$). Accordingly the power spectrum bias, if uncorrected, translates into \$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ errors in the determination of the intrinsic alignment amplitude in case of {CMB} stage {III} and stage {IV} experiments, respectively.},

@article{merkel_intrinsic_2013,
	Abstract = {In this paper we show how intrinsic alignments can be incorporated consistently in the formalism of 3d weak lensing. We use two different descriptions of the intrinsic galaxy ellipticities, the so-called linear and quadratic model, respectively. For both models we derive the covariance matrix of the intrinsic alignment signal ({II}-alignments) and {GI}-alignments (the cross correlation of intrinsic and lensing induced ellipticities). Evaluating the covariance matrices for the linear model numerically and comparing the results to the cosmic shear signal we find that for a low redshift survey the total covariance matrix is dominated by the contributions of the {II}-alignments. For a Euclid-like survey {II}-alignments still dominate over {GI}-alignments but they are more than one order of magnitude smaller than the lensing signal. The shape of the ellipticity covariance matrices is quite different in the k-k'-plane for cosmic shear on the one hand and intrinsic alignments on the other hand. In comparison to lensing both alignment types tend to be rather elongated along the diagonal k=k'. Moreover, for high multipoles (l {\textasciitilde} 100) intrinsic alignments are strongly concentrated along that diagonal.},

@article{merkel_theoretical_2014,
	Abstract = {Intrinsically aligned galaxy shapes are one of the most important systematics in cosmic shear measurements. So far theoretical studies of intrinsic alignments almost exclusively focus on their statistics at the two-point level. Results from numerical simulations, however, suggest that third-order measures might be even stronger affected. We therefore investigate the (angular) bispectrum of intrinsic alignments. In our fully analytical study we describe intrinsic galaxy ellipticities by a physical alignment model, which makes use of tidal torque theory. We derive expressions for the various combinations of intrinsic and gravitationally induced ellipticities, i.e. {III}-, {GII}- and {GGI}-alignments, and compare our results to the shear bispectrum, the {GGG}-term. The latter is computed using hyper-extended perturbation theory. Considering equilateral and squeezed configurations we find that for a Euclid-like survey intrinsic alignments ({III}-alignments) start to dominate on angular scales smaller than 20 arcmin and 13 arcmin, respectively. This sensitivity to the configuration-space geometry may allow to exploit the cosmological information contained in both the intrinsic and gravitationally induced ellipticity field. On smallest scales (l {\textasciitilde} 3000) {III}-alignments exceed the lensing signal by at least one order of magnitude. The amplitude of the {GGI}-alignments is the weakest. It stays below that of the shear field on all angular scales irrespective of the wave-vector configuration.},

@article{pandya_can_2019,
	Abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope observations show that low-mass (\$M\_*=10{\textasciicircum}9-10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) galaxies at high redshift (\$z=1.0-2.5\$) tend to be elongated (prolate) rather than disky (oblate) or spheroidal. This is explained in zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by the fact that these galaxies are forming in cosmic web filaments where accretion happens preferentially along the direction of elongation. We ask whether the elongated morphology of these galaxies allows them to be used as effective tracers of cosmic web filaments at high redshift via their intrinsic alignments. Using mock lightcones and spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy pairs from the {CANDELS} survey, we test two types of alignments: (1) between the galaxy major axis and the direction to nearby galaxies of any mass, and (2) between the major axes of nearby pairs of low-mass, likely prolate, galaxies. The mock lightcones predict strong signals in 3D real space, 3D redshift space, and 2D projected redshift space for both types of alignments (assuming prolate galaxy orientations are the same as those of their host prolate halos), but we do not detect significant alignment signals in {CANDELS} observations. However, we show that spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for only a small fraction of highly elongated galaxies, and accounting for spectroscopic incompleteness and redshift errors significantly degrades the 2D mock signal. This may partly explain the alignment discrepancy and highlights one of several avenues for future work.},

@article{reischke_environmental_2018,
	Abstract = {In this work we investigate the environmental dependence of the intrinsic ellipticity correlations in cosmic shear surveys. We use the quadratic and linear alignment model to describe the contributions by spiral and elliptical galaxies, respectively. The density field is in both cases described by a Gaussian random field and ellipticity correlation functions that are conditional on the environment of the galaxies are constructed by sampling random values for the tidal tensor and inertial tensor. The covariance of the Gaussian random process from which the tensor entries are drawn is decomposed by means of a spherical Fourier-Bessel transformation of the density field. The dependence on environment is modelled by the number of positive eigenvalues of the tidal tensor, which allows a differentiation between voids, sheets, filaments and superclusters. We find that elliptical galaxies align strongest in elongated structures such as sheets and filaments with an amplitude almost an order of magnitude higher compared to the alignment in clusters or voids. In contrast to this, spiral galaxies align equally strong in all environments. Cross-alignments between different environments are smaller than the respective auto-correlations subject to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which is an effective bound on their amplitude. Furthermore, we find misalignment between inertial and tidal tensor to be stronger in anisotropic regions compared to clusters or voids. While the imprint of weak lensing on galaxy ellipticities is agnostic about the environment, using environment information can help to distinguish between lensing and the intrinsic alignment signal.},

@article{schaefer_angular_2015,
	Abstract = {Subject of this paper are intrinsic ellipticity correlations between galaxies, their statistical properties, their observability with future surveys and their interference with weak gravitational lensing measurements. Using an angular momentum-based, quadratic intrinsic alignment model we derive correlation functions of the ellipticity components and project them to yield the four non-zero angular ellipticity spectra \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_E({\textbackslash}ell)\$, \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_B({\textbackslash}ell)\$, \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_C({\textbackslash}ell)\$ and \$C{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_S({\textbackslash}ell)\$ in their generalisation to tomographic surveys. For a Euclid-like survey, these spectra would have amplitudes smaller than the weak lensing effect on nonlinear structures, but would constitute an important systematic. Computing estimation biases for cosmological parameters derived from an alignment-contaminated survey suggests biases of \$+5{\textbackslash}sigma\_w\$ for the dark energy equation of state parameter \$w\$, \$-20{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_m\}\$ for the matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and \$-12{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\}\$ for the spectrum normalisation \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$. Intrinsic alignments yield a signal which is easily observable with a survey similar to Euclid: While not independent, significances for estimates of each of the four spectra reach values of tens of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ if weak lensing and shape noise are considered as noise sources, which suggests relative uncertainties on alignment parameters at the percent level.},

	Abstract = {We show that the spatial correlation of the intrinsic alignments ({IAs}) of galaxies, measured in galaxy redshift surveys, offers a precision route to improve the geometrical and dynamical constraints on cosmology. The {IA} has been treated as a contaminant against cosmological probes such as weak gravitational lensing experiments, but the large-scale correlation of {IAs} is expected to follow the coherent large-scale matter inhomogeneities. In particular, the statistics of {IA} inherently possess anisotropic nature, and in combination with the conventional galaxy clustering statistics, the large-scale {IA} correlations help to improve the measurements of the geometric distances and growth of structure. Here, we quantify the potential power of {IA}, and show that with their improved measurements, the constraints on equation-of-state parameter for dark energy and Hubble parameter can be tighter than those from the clustering statistics alone by a factor of more than 1.5.},

@article{tugendhat_angular_2018,
	Abstract = {We investigate a physical, composite alignment model for both spiral and elliptical galaxies and its impact on cosmological parameter estimation from weak lensing for a tomographic survey. Ellipticity correlation functions and angular ellipticity spectra for spiral and elliptical galaxies are derived on the basis of tidal interactions with the cosmic large-scale structure and compared to the tomographic weak lensing signal. We find that elliptical galaxies cause a contribution to the weak-lensing dominated ellipticity correlation on intermediate angular scales between \${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}simeq40\$ and \${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}simeq400\$ before that of spiral galaxies dominates on higher multipoles. The predominant term on intermediate scales is the negative cross-correlation between intrinsic alignments and weak gravitational lensing ({GI}-alignment). We simulate parameter inference from weak gravitational lensing with intrinsic alignments unaccounted; the bias induced by ignoring intrinsic alignments in a survey like Euclid is shown to be several times larger than the statistical error and can lead to faulty conclusions when comparing to other observations. The biases generally point into different directions in parameter space, such that in some cases one can observe a partial cancellation effect. Furthermore, it is shown that the biases increase with the number of tomographic bins used for the parameter estimation process. We quantify this parameter estimation bias in units of the statistical error and compute the loss of Bayesian evidence for a model due to the presence of systematic errors as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distance between the true model and the wrongly inferred one.},

	Abstract = {We present a general perturbative effective field theory ({EFT}) description of galaxy shape correlations, which are commonly known as intrinsic alignments. This rigorous approach extends current analytical modelling strategies in that it only relies on the equivalence principle. We present our results in terms of three-dimensional statistics for two- and three-point functions of both galaxy shapes and number counts. In case of the two-point function, we recover the well-known linear alignment result at leading order, but also present the full next-to-leading order expressions. In case of the three-point function we present leading order results for all the auto- and cross-correlations of galaxy shapes and densities. We use a spherical tensor basis to decompose the tensor perturbations in different helicity modes, which allows us to make use of isotropy and parity properties in the correlators. Combined with the results on projection presented in a forthcoming companion paper, our framework is directly applicable to accounting for intrinsic alignment contamination in weak lensing surveys, and to extracting cosmological information from intrinsic alignments.},

@article{yao_effects_2017,
	Abstract = {Intrinsic alignments ({IA}) of galaxies have been recognized as one of the most serious contaminants to weak lensing. These systematics need to be isolated and mitigated in order for ongoing and future lensing surveys to reach their full potential. The {IA} self-calibration ({SC}) method was shown in previous studies to be able to reduce the {GI} contamination by up to a factor of 10 for the 2-point and 3-point correlations. The {SC} method does not require to assume an {IA} model in its working and can extract the {GI} signal from the same photo-z survey offering the possibility to test and understand structure formation scenarios and their relationship to {IA} models. In this paper, we study the effects of the {IA} {SC} mitigation method on the precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter constraints from future cosmic shear surveys {LSST}, {WFIRST} and Euclid. We perform analytical and numerical calculations to estimate the loss of precision and the residual bias in the best fit cosmological parameters after the self-calibration is performed. We take into account uncertainties from photometric redshifts and the galaxy bias. We find that the confidence contours are slightly inflated from applying the {SC} method itself while a significant increase is due to the inclusion of the photo-z uncertainties. The bias of cosmological parameters is reduced from several-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, when {IA} is not corrected for, to below 1-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ after {SC} is applied. These numbers are comparable to those resulting from applying the method of marginalizing over {IA} model parameters despite the fact that the two methods operate very differently. We conclude that implementing the {SC} for these future cosmic-shear surveys will not only allow one to efficiently mitigate the {GI} contaminant but also help to understand their modeling and link to structure formation.},

@article{yao_self-calibration_2018,
	Abstract = {We introduce a self-calibration method that can be applied to the intrinsic ellipticity--intrinsic ellipticity ({II}) and gravitational shear -- intrinsic ellipticity ({GI}) types of intrinsic alignment of galaxies. The method combines previous self-calibration techniques with modifications to one of them in order to use auto-spectra in addition to cross-spectra between redshift bins. This allows one to use the self-calibration while preserving all the constraining power of cosmic shear from surveys. We show that the new method provides more flexibility in using various redshift bin widths. We perform cosmological parameter constraint forecast when this method is applied to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}). Compared to the original self-calibration, we find that the new method provides further significant reduction in any residual shift in the cosmological parameters (e.g. factors of \$2-4\$ for the dark energy equation of state) which is promising for accurate cosmology.},

@article{yao_separating_2019,
	Abstract = {To reach the full potential for the next generation of weak lensing surveys, it is necessary to mitigate the contamination of intrinsic alignments ({IA}) of galaxies in the observed cosmic shear signal. The self calibration ({SC}) of intrinsic alignments provides an independent method to measure the {IA} signal from the survey data and the photometric redshift information. It operates differently from the marginalization method based on {IA} modeling. In this work, we present the first application of {SC} to the {KiDS}450 data and the {KV}450 data, to split directly the intrinsic shape - galaxy density (Ig) correlation signal and the gravitational shear - galaxy density (Gg) correlation signal, using the information from photometric redshift (photo-z). We achieved a clear separation of the two signals and performed several validation tests. Our measured signals are found to be in general agreement with the {KiDS}450 cosmic shear best-fit cosmology, for both lensing and {IA} measurements. For {KV}450, we use partial (high-z) data, and our lensing measurements are also in good agreement with {KV}450 cosmic shear best-fit, however, our {IA} signal suggests a larger {IA} amplitude. We discussed the impact of photo-z quality on {IA} detection and several other potential systematic biases. Finally, we discuss the potential application of the information extracted for both the lensing signal and the {IA} signal in future surveys.},

@article{piras_mass_2018,
	Abstract = {Tidal gravitational forces can modify the shape of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, thus correlating their orientation with the surrounding matter density field. We study the dependence of this phenomenon, known as intrinsic alignment ({IA}), on the mass of the dark matter haloes that host these bright structures, analysing the Millennium and Millennium-{XXL} N-body simulations. We closely follow the observational approach, measuring the halo position-halo shape alignment and subsequently dividing out the dependence on halo bias. We derive a theoretical scaling of the {IA} amplitude with mass in a dark matter universe, and predict a power-law with slope βM in the range 1/3 to 1/2, depending on mass scale. We find that the simulation data agree with each other and with the theoretical prediction remarkably well over three orders of magnitude in mass, with the joint analysis yielding an estimate of βM = 0.36−+00..0011. This result does not depend on redshift or on the details of the halo shape measurement. The analysis is repeated on observational data, obtaining a significantly higher value, βM = 0.56−+00..0055. There are also small but significant deviations from our simple model in the simulation signals at both the high- and low-mass end. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies, and argue that they can be attributed to physical processes not captured in the model or in the dark matter-only simulations.},
